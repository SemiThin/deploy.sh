1) This 1st step can be run either on Linux platform or on Windows platform as
follows:

1-1) On Linux platform, on a terminal cd to directory where holds these files:
cadence.txt, licgen.bat, licgen.sh, lmcrypt.exe, and README. Make sure 
licgen.sh and lmcrypt.exe are executable. Then run the following command:
./licgen.sh
which will produce the output file license.dat in the same directory.

On a 64-bit Linux host, you probably need to install a 32-bit library 
libp11-kit-gnome-keyring before you can run this step, e.g. on Ubuntu 
run the following command to install this library:
sudo apt-get install libp11-kit-gnome-keyring:i386

1-2) Alternatively on Windows platform (e.g. Windows virtual machine installed on linux), 
navigate to the folder where holds these files:
cadence.txt, licgen.bat, licgen.sh, lmcrypt.exe, and README.
then click licgen.bat to run.
which will produce the output file license.dat in the same folder.

2) Open the license.dat file produced in the above step 1 and remove the top 
4 lines (SERVER, DAEMON,... lines) before the 1st FEATURE line and then save the file. 
Note: the saved file license.dat now contains FEATURE lines ONLY!. Move or copy this 
license.dat to <Cadence_install_dir>/license directory, e.g. /opt/cadence/license
Make sure all Cadence tools have the access right to this license file (use chown 
and/or chmod to change the file access if necessary)!

3) You can add any new (or missing) license FEATUREs to cadence.txt (make sure the
license strings (keys) are in correct syntax and spelling) or make a brand new cadence.txt
and then re-run the above 2 steps to produce license.dat file.

The FEATURE line format in the cadence.txt is as follows:
FEATURE license_key cdslmd 2100.000 permanent uncounted HOSTID=ANY [optioanl_attributes] SIGN2=0
where cdslmd is the Cadence license server daemon; 2100.000 is the license version;
permanent (or 0 for year in date-month-year, e.g. 30-nov-0 or 30-nov-0000) is the
license expiration date (never expires here!); uncounted (or 0) is the number of
license uses allowed (unlimited use here!); HOSTID=ANY means this license is a floating 
license and does not attach to any node in the network. The "permanent" and 
"uncounted" are the reserved keywords in FlexNet/Flexlm license scheme.

optional_attributes includes VENDOR_STRING, vendor_info, ISSUER, ISSUED and SN, etc. 
e.g. VENDOR_STRING=UHD:PERM. vendor_info=01-oct-2015 and ISSUED=01-oct-2015. 
SN uses the following format: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss:xxx where xxx < 1000, 
e.g. SN=2015-10-01T08:04:11:846. These optioanl_attributes can be automatically
produced by lmcrypt if the lmcrypt was created correctly in the first place.

Other EDA vendors have their own license server daemons, e.g. mgcld is Mentor
Graphics license server daemon.  The above steps can also be applied to these 
other EDA vendors for their FlexNet/Flexlm license files provided you have 
the lmcrypt.exe for particular EDA vendor. This lmcrypt.exe can be made
from Flexlm SDK if you can figure out some keywords for each EDA vendor -
search Internet for this hack.

NOTES:
In FlexNet (Flexlm) scheme, once all FEATUREs are set to uncounted (or 0) for the
number of concurrent license uses in the FEATURE lines, the license server is
no longer needed, that is, you DO NOT need to start up the SERVER DAEMON to
run any of these features. Therefore, the SERVER, VENDOR, and USE_SERVER lines
can be safely removed in the license,dat file, that is, the license.dat here is a
pure FEATURE file without any other lines. In this case, make sure to use absolute
PATH to the license.dat file for the environment variable CDS_LIC_FILE:
CDS_LIC_FILE=<Cadence_install_dir>/license/license.dat 
instead of CDS_LIC_FILE=port@hostname.

User Guides for all Cadence tools can be found in <tool_install_dir>/doc directory, 
e.g., user guides related to Virtuoso can be found in <IC616_install_dir>/doc and 
specifically the Virtuoso Licensing & Configuration User Guide is in 
<IC616_install_dir>/doc/dfIIconfig directory. You can find license strings/keys for 
each Cadence tool in the respective doc directory, 
e.g. <Conformal_install_dir>/doc/Conformal_Product

Each Cadence tool also comes with a Flexim User Guide in <tool_install_dir>/share/license
directory e.g. <INCISIVE_install_dir>/share/license
